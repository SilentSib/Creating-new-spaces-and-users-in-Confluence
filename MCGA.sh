# uses packages pwgen, jq and maybe lastpass-cli

# to-do: 
# - offer choice to create additional users in the same group once first one done -> done
# - check if maximum user count has been reached every time when creating new user (/rest/license/1.0/license/remainingSeats) -> done
# - offer a summary of all new users created to X group at the end (one per line)
# - consider that the group entered when creating a new user doesn't exist yet and prompt to create it
# - sanitization of user input
